# A Driven-Damped Pendulum
A simuilation of a damped/driven pendulum which provides a phase diagram of the motion along with a Poincaré map. There is also a script to generate Bifurcation Diagrams using the same simulation engine.

Try running the driven_pendulum.py script without any arguments to get an idea of how the pendulum works. Use the --help flag for an explanation of which optional arguments you can pass in to change the parameters.

Bifurcation Diagrams allow you to see how the behavior of the pendulum evolves as the amplitude of the drive force increases. For each value of the amplitude the a one-dimensioanal projection of the Poincaré map is plotted parrallel to the y-axis. As a result we can see how the behavior of the pendulum changes on a large scale. Try running the bifurcation.py script without any arguments to get an idea of how it works. Use the --help flag for an explanation of which optional arguments you can use to change the parameters.
